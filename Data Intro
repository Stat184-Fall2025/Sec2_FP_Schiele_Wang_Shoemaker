	Every year, the United States imports billions of dollars worth of food from other countries, to feed it’s people and to resell. The composition of these imports has changed; over time, it has become a global endeavor, with the United States now importing food and related goods from almost every country in the World. The US government keeps a record of the past 20 years of trade data and has made it available to the public. That data is what we will be using in this project. The data is neatly divided as a CSV file into different categories, countries, and years to make it easy for data manipulation and calculation. Using this, we will observe how US trade data can be categorized and how it has changed over time.

# U.S. Food Import Data from years 1999 to 2024

This repo contains the important files about our project. These are documents such as the cmd file which contains all of the important data. It also has the html/pdf file which provides an easy to read presentation of our project. 

## Overview

This project is aiming at exploring the food imports data set, by showing insights on trends throughout the years, who the biggest exporters to the U.S. are, and other interesting ways of viewing this data set.

## Data Sources and Acknowledgements

The data used in this project for the food imports data set was sourced from the U. S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service, and U. S. Food Imports Data.

## Current Plan

The primary goal for this project is to create insightful and interesting visualizations that show the key trends that appear in the U.S. food imports through the years 1999 to 2024.

Planned visualizations include:

- The top 10 countries by total food import value through the years 1999 to 2024, which will show the U.S.’s biggest food suppliers.
- Year-over-year percentage change in total food import value to the US, showing the different percentages of change that happen to the total imported food value compared to the previous year.
- Total value of different food commodities imported from Canada, from years 1999 to 2024, showing what are the trends for the main food commodities imported by Canada.
- And other visualizations that showcase trends on U.S. food import data.

These visualizations should make it so it is easier to better understand the long-term trends, who are the U.S.’s dominant trade partners, and other interesting insights.

## Repo Structure

This repository has a very simple structure with really only 3 documents being important: the README file, the .qmd file, and the .pdf file.

- README.md: this file provides a description of the repository, an overview of what the project is aiming to do, data sources, a plan for the project, a structure of the repository, and information about the authors.
- Project-name.qmd: The main Quatro file which contains the code, data analysis, data visualizations, and narratives about the visualizations and overall trends.
- Project-name.pdf: The rendered version of the Quatro file which.

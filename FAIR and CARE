	Our data satisfies both the FAIR and CARE principles of data. Our data is FAIR because it is easily findable and accessible to anybody since it just exists on a government website and can be simply downloaded as a CSV file before being uploaded anywhere. As a CSV file, it is very interoperable; when uploaded into R, we could immediately work on it very easily. The data is also reusable since the government kept records of how the data was kept and stored. For CARE, we use the data to gain insights about the evolving world, which is beneficial to everyone. The data was collected in a way where the US Government (the collector) has authority over it since it is their financial records, and the data was collected from governments that can regulate what is shared. We made sure to use this data ethically and responsibly, not making any judgments or treating different nations unfairly.
